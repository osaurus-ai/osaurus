# OsaurusEvals

Catalog-driven behaviour / integration tests for Osaurus that hit a real model (Foundation, MLX, remote provider).

These evals are deliberately **off the CI path**. They burn LLM tokens, depend on local plugin installs, and exist to help us tune capabilities and triage new models — not to gate every commit.

A "suite" is just a directory of `*.json` case files. Add a new case by dropping a JSON file in — no Swift edit required.

## Running

The repo `Makefile` exposes two targets that wrap the CLI from the workspace
root — easier than `cd`'ing into the package every time:

```bash
# From the repo root:
make evals                                          # default model (current core model)
make evals MODEL=foundation                         # Apple Foundation Models
make evals MODEL=openai/gpt-4o-mini                 # remote provider
make evals MODEL=mlx-community/Qwen3-4B-MLX-4bit    # specific local MLX model
make evals FILTER=browser-amazon                    # single case while iterating
make evals-report                                   # also writes build/evals.json
make evals-report EVALS_OUT=reports/today.json      # custom output path
make evals EVALS_SUITE=Packages/OsaurusEvals/Suites/AgentLoop  # other suite
make evals-pr-report LOCAL_MODEL=foundation FRONTIER_MODEL=openai/gpt-4o-mini
make evals-pr-report-baseline BASELINE_DIR=build/evals/main-report
make evals-watcher-report EVALS_WATCHER_CHANNEL=main EVALS_REPORT_PRESET=local-frontier
make evals-scoreboard EVALS_SCOREBOARD_ROOT=build/evals/watcher/main EVALS_MAX_REGRESSIONS=0
```

### Asset prerequisites (handled automatically)

Local MLX model evals and `capability_search` need two assets that the SwiftPM
CLI can't bundle for itself:

- **MLX metallib** — local MLX model loads fail with "Failed to load the default
  metallib" unless `default.metallib` sits next to the `osaurus-evals` binary
  (SwiftPM CLI builds don't embed the Cmlx Metal library the way `make app`
  does).
- **`minishlab/potion-base-4M` embedder** — without it the capability_search
  semantic index is empty and retrieval results are unreliable.

Every `make evals*` target now runs `make evals-prep` first, which executes
`scripts/evals/prepare-evals-env.sh` to colocate the metallib (from an existing
`make app` / Xcode build, or `OSAURUS_MLX_METALLIB`) and download the embedder
into the Hugging Face cache (via `hf` or `uvx`). It's idempotent and a no-op
once both assets are in place. Skip it with `OSAURUS_EVALS_SKIP_PREP=1` (or run
`make evals-prep` standalone). When you invoke `swift run osaurus-evals`
directly, the CLI falls back to colocating the metallib at startup and logs a
loud warning if the embedder is missing.

The `CapabilityClaims` browser cases run against the built-in `browser_use`
tool (the browser is now a native Osaurus capability; the `osaurus.browser`
plugin is superseded), so no plugin install is needed for them. When a
selected case declares `fixtures.requirePlugins`, the runner auto-bootstraps
installed plugins (no `--bootstrap-plugins` needed); pass
`--no-plugin-bootstrap` to force-skip them.

Or call the CLI directly if you need flags the Makefile doesn't expose:

```bash
cd Packages/OsaurusEvals
swift run osaurus-evals run --suite Suites/CapabilitySearch --model foundation
swift run osaurus-evals run --suite Suites/CapabilitySearch --filter browser --out report.json
swift run osaurus-evals run --suite Suites/CapabilitySearch --bootstrap-plugins

# Several suites in ONE process — the model loads + warms once and stays
# resident across them. Reports land at <out-dir>/<out-prefix><Suite>.json.
swift run osaurus-evals run --suite Suites/AgentLoop --suite Suites/CapabilityClaims \
  --model mlx-community/Qwen3-4B-4bit --out-dir build/evals --out-prefix llm-qwen-

# Repeat every case 3× (same warm process) and report the merged majority
# outcome + per-case passRate; rows with mixed trial outcomes are marked FLAKY.
swift run osaurus-evals run --suite Suites/AgentLoop --repeat 3 --out report.json

# Resume an interrupted run: completed rows are carried from report.json's
# .partial.jsonl sidecar (written incrementally as each case finishes) or from
# the previous report itself; only missing/errored/watchdog-blocked rows re-run.
swift run osaurus-evals run --suite Suites/AgentLoop --out report.json --resume

# Keep full forensics for every failed/errored LLM case: system prompt, each
# tool call with arguments + result preview, final text, loop notices — one
# JSON per failing case under report.transcripts/. Off by default (transcripts
# carry the whole composed prompt; shared reports shouldn't).
swift run osaurus-evals run --suite Suites/AgentLoop --out report.json --transcripts

# Build a maintainer-facing PR report bundle.
swift run osaurus-evals report --local-model foundation --frontier-model openai/gpt-4o-mini
```

### Context optimization harness (`optimize-context`)

The staged search that answers "where do the tokens go, and what can we
remove without losing quality":

1. **Census (no model)** — composes the REAL preview surface (same gates as
   the send path) for the production baseline, then every one-factor
   ablation the validator allows: each droppable prompt section, each
   deferrable tool, the compact-prompt toggle.
2. **Prune** — axes that compose invalid or save less than `--min-savings`
   (default 25 estimated tokens) are recorded in `plan.json` but never cost
   a model run.
3. **Combine** — survivors merge into combination candidates
   (`combo-sections`, `combo-tools`, `combo-all`) plus the named
   architecture candidates: `arch-hot-set` (immutable hot tool set,
   everything else defers to discovery), `arch-lean-guidance` (always-on
   guidance prose dropped), `arch-manifest-replacement` (prompt manifest
   replaced by the exact paginated `capabilities_discover
   {"list": "enabled"}` mode), and `arch-compact-loaded-results`
   (compacted `capabilities_load` results — a cumulative-token axis, so it
   is exempt from the surface-savings floor).
   Architecture and combo candidates always earn a model run;
   `--max-candidates` caps how many single-axis candidates join them
   (largest surface savers first).
4. **Quality runs** — baseline FIRST, then every candidate, over the same
   scoped suites in ONE process (the model loads and warms once; profiles
   swap through the eval-only experiment scope between runs). Each
   candidate is diffed against the in-process baseline with the flake-aware
   `EvalDiff` gate.
5. **Pareto** — gate-passing candidates rank on pass rate, first-step
   context, cumulative context, peak context, TTFT, throughput, and RAM;
   `pareto.md` marks the non-dominated frontier.
6. **Finalists + strict promotion gate** — the baseline and every frontier
   candidate rerun at `--finalist-repeat` trials (default 5), then
   `PromotionGate` applies the STRICT rules: no baseline pass→fail
   transitions (no flake amnesty), no new failures/errors/skips, no lower
   per-case pass rate on repeat-trial rows, judge-calibration lane must
   pass, unchanged case catalog, and the optional `--context-budget`
   ceiling on mean first-step tokens. Verdicts land in `promotion.md`.

#### Exact Bonsai Ternary commands

The xAI key is supplied ONLY via the environment (`XAI_API_KEY`); it is
never written to config, scripts, reports, or logs, and should be rotated
after a shared run. With the key set, the judge auto-resolves to
`xai/grok-4.3`.

```bash
cd Packages/OsaurusEvals

# Deterministic plan only (seconds, no model):
XAI_API_KEY=... swift run osaurus-evals optimize-context \
  --suite Suites/AgentLoop \
  --model "OsaurusAI/Bonsai-27b-Ternary-JANG" \
  --out-dir build/ctxopt-bonsai --census-only

# The full search (hours on a 27B local model — resumable):
XAI_API_KEY=... swift run osaurus-evals optimize-context \
  --suite Suites/AgentLoop --suite Suites/CapabilityClaims \
  --model "OsaurusAI/Bonsai-27b-Ternary-JANG" \
  --out-dir build/ctxopt-bonsai \
  --repeat 3 --finalist-repeat 5 --max-candidates 8 --resume

# Or through the loop script (artifacts under the stamped run dir):
CTX_OPTIMIZE=1 MODELS="OsaurusAI/Bonsai-27b-Ternary-JANG" \
CTX_SUITES="AgentLoop" CTX_REPEAT=3 XAI_API_KEY=... \
scripts/evals/optimization-loop.sh
```

#### Reading the artifacts

- `plan.json` — the census: baseline surface tokens, every candidate with
  its `kind` and `surfaceSavings`, and every pruned axis with the reason.
- `baseline.json` / `candidate-<name>.json` — merged env-stamped reports;
  profiled reports carry `experimentProfile` + `experimentProfileHash` in
  their environment, so they can never silently read as production.
- `pareto.md` — the ranking table; `★` rows are the gate-passing,
  non-dominated frontier. A candidate missing from the frontier is
  dominated or gate-failed (see the Gate Failures section).
- `finalist-*.json` + `promotion.md` — the strict verdicts. Only a
  `PROMOTABLE` finalist may be promoted to production composition.

#### Promotion rules (never weaken these)

- Promote only `PROMOTABLE` finalists, and only when the finalist run used
  ≥5 trials per case against a same-process baseline.
- A pass→fail flip on a flaky row means MORE trials, not promotion.
- Never weaken case expectations, inject model-family coercion, repair
  parser output, or hide failures to make a candidate pass.
- The prompt manifest stays in production until `arch-manifest-replacement`
  passes CapabilityClaims and tool-use gates — the exact
  `capabilities_discover {"list": "enabled"}` listing exists precisely so
  that experiment is honest.
- Per-case context ceilings (`expect.agentLoop.scoredMaxPromptTokens` /
  `scoredMaxTotalTokens`) should be added to representative agent-loop
  cases only AFTER a stable baseline exists, set from observed baseline +
  margin — they are regression tripwires, not targets.

#### Bonsai 27B Ternary JANG results (2026-07-22)

Full staged run: 10 representative AgentLoop cases + CapabilityClaims +
JudgeCalibration, 3 trials per case in search, 5 in finalists, judge
`xai/grok-4.3`. Baseline surface 4984 tok; baseline quality 29/32.

| Profile | Search (3×) | 1st-step | cum/task | Verdict |
| --- | --- | ---: | ---: | --- |
| `arch-compact-loaded-results` | 27/32 | ±0% | −12% | **PROMOTABLE** (clean 5-trial pass) |
| `arch-lean-guidance` | 28/32 | −13% | −17% | BLOCKED (one flaky claims row 4/5→1/5 — rerun with more trials) |
| `arch-hot-set` | 27/32 | −18% | −12% | gate FAIL (`no-clarify` regression) |
| `arch-manifest-replacement` | 27/32 | −30% | −37% | gate FAIL (claims honesty + `no-spurious-discover` regress) |
| `combo-sections` / `combo-tools` / `combo-all` | ≤27/32 | up to −73% | up to −50% | gate FAIL (multiple hard regressions) |

Conclusions the evidence supports:

- **Winning profile: [`Profiles/arch-compact-loaded-results.json`](Profiles/arch-compact-loaded-results.json)**
  — the only candidate to survive the strict promotion gate. Its savings
  are history-side (−12% cumulative on capability-loading tasks), not
  surface-side, and cost zero quality.
- **Best trade, pending evidence:
  [`Profiles/arch-lean-guidance.json`](Profiles/arch-lean-guidance.json)**
  — beat baseline in the 5-trial finalist aggregate (26/29 vs 25/29,
  −17% first-step, −22% cumulative in finalists, two claims rows
  IMPROVED) but is blocked, correctly, on a single flaky-row pass→fail
  flip. Next action: rerun finalists at higher trials
  (`--finalist-repeat 9`); do not promote over the gate.
- **Keep the enabled manifest and the full tool schema.** The manifest
  replacement (even with the exact `{"list": "enabled"}` mode available)
  and the hot-set/deferral architectures all produced real regressions on
  Bonsai Ternary — grounding-by-prompt is what this model's honesty
  depends on. These are documented negative results, not failures of the
  harness.

Artifacts for this run live under `build/ctxopt-bonsai/run1/`
(`plan.json`, `pareto.md`, `promotion.md`, per-profile reports with full
context attribution).

### Screen Context capture lab

`ScreenContext` cases replay a frozen Accessibility-tree fixture through the
production `ScreenContextDistiller`. This keeps the suite deterministic and
CI-safe while still matching the live text-only screen-context path.

Use `capture-screen` locally when tuning a new desktop shape:

```bash
# Capture the frontmost app into the gitignored local fixture directory.
swift run --package-path Packages/OsaurusEvals osaurus-evals capture-screen --render

# Capture a named running app.
swift run --package-path Packages/OsaurusEvals osaurus-evals capture-screen \
  --app Safari --out Packages/OsaurusEvals/Fixtures/ScreenContext/local/safari.json --render

# Inspect a fixture without Accessibility permission.
swift run --package-path Packages/OsaurusEvals osaurus-evals capture-screen \
  --describe Packages/OsaurusEvals/Fixtures/ScreenContext/local/safari.json

# Create a sanitized promotion candidate before hand-editing and committing.
swift run --package-path Packages/OsaurusEvals osaurus-evals capture-screen \
  --promote Packages/OsaurusEvals/Fixtures/ScreenContext/local/safari.json --render
```

Real captures contain local screen text and stay under
`Packages/OsaurusEvals/Fixtures/ScreenContext/local/`, which is ignored. Only
commit hand-reviewed synthetic or sanitized fixtures. The promotion helper keeps
roles, geometry, actions, and focus shape, but redacts captured strings, drops
secure-field values, removes AX paths, and rewrites element ids.

For maintainer proof on agent-loop changes, use the PR report bundle when you
need local + frontier evidence in one artifact:

```bash
make evals-pr-report \
  LOCAL_MODEL=foundation \
  FRONTIER_MODEL=openai/gpt-4o-mini

make evals-pr-report-baseline \
  BASELINE_DIR=build/evals/main-report \
  LOCAL_MODEL=foundation \
  FRONTIER_MODEL=openai/gpt-4o-mini
```

The default report runs `AgentLoop` and `AgentLoopFrontier` for both the local
and frontier lanes. It writes `build/evals/pr-report/<timestamp>/` unless
`EVALS_PR_REPORT_OUT` or `--out-dir` is set:

- `manifest.json` — commit, branch, date, runner version, suites, models,
  command provenance, and environment summary.
- `summary.md` — maintainer-readable totals, failures, skips, regressions, and
  the exact commands used.
- `summary.json` — machine-readable aggregate summary.
- `evidence-registry.json` — unified evidence registry snapshot pointing at
  the report `summary.json` artifact.
- `reports/<role>/<model>/<suite>.json` — raw `EvalReport` output for each lane.
- `compare.md` / `compare.json` — baseline-vs-current diff when a baseline is
  supplied.

Use this evidence rule for PRs:

- No eval report needed: docs-only changes, UI-only inspection, isolated
  storage changes, and non-agent diagnostics.
- Focused eval report needed: eval harness, provider bootstrap, or scoring
  changes.
- Local + frontier eval report required: default tools, tool schemas,
  prompt/tool interaction, agent-loop routing, memory/tool routing, and
  model-facing defaults.

PR evidence block:

```text
Eval evidence:
- Local: <model>, AgentLoop X/Y, AgentLoopFrontier X/Y
- Frontier: <model>, AgentLoop X/Y, AgentLoopFrontier X/Y
- Regressions vs baseline: <none/list>
- Artifact: <path or uploaded artifact>
```

The `--from-reports <dir>` flag builds the bundle from existing `EvalReport`
JSON files without model calls, which is useful for CLI smoke tests and docs
examples.

For mainline and release-candidate watcher runs, use the stored artifact
workflow:

```bash
make evals-watcher-report \
  EVALS_WATCHER_CHANNEL=main \
  EVALS_WATCHER_ARTIFACT_ID=main-$(date -u +%Y%m%dT%H%M%SZ) \
  LOCAL_MODEL=foundation \
  FRONTIER_MODEL=openai/gpt-4o-mini

make evals-watcher-report \
  EVALS_WATCHER_CHANNEL=release-candidate \
  EVALS_WATCHER_ARTIFACT_ID=rc-agent-loop-20260621 \
  BASELINE_DIR=build/evals/watcher/main/20260621T120000Z/report
```

Each run stores a report bundle under
`build/evals/watcher/<channel>/<timestamp>/report/` and refreshes
`build/evals/watcher/<channel>/scoreboard/latest/scoreboard.json` plus
`scoreboard.md`. Report and scoreboard directories also write
`evidence-registry.json`; the scoreboard rebuild discovers eval report bundles
through those registry snapshots and then reads their registered `summary.json`
artifacts. The manifest carries the artifact ID, and the scoreboard summarizes
the latest release-candidate run, local/frontier model presets, baseline
comparison counts, and the no-regression threshold
(`EVALS_MAX_REGRESSIONS`, default `0`). Reused registry IDs follow the evidence
registry's newest-registration precedence. The watcher verifies that the
current report is the selected release candidate and preserves report failures
in its final exit status. The scoreboard can also be rebuilt from existing
registry-backed bundles without running a model:

```bash
make evals-scoreboard \
  EVALS_SCOREBOARD_ROOT=build/evals/watcher/main \
  EVALS_SCOREBOARD_OUT=build/evals/scoreboard/main \
  EVALS_MAX_REGRESSIONS=0

swift run --package-path Packages/OsaurusEvals osaurus-evals scoreboard \
  --reports-root build/evals/watcher/main \
  --out-dir build/evals/scoreboard/main \
  --max-regressions 0
```

Use `EVALS_REPORT_PRESET=local-only` for fixture or local-only validation that
must not require frontier credentials; the default remains `local-frontier` for
release evidence.

See `docs/EVAL_WATCHER.md` for the maintainer loop, optional dedicated Mac
runner notes, and cost controls.

For lower-level agent-loop baseline work, use the regression lab. It runs
selected `agent_loop` suites, writes per-suite JSON artifacts, compares the
current run against a saved baseline report or report directory, and emits a
concise JSON + Markdown summary:

```bash
scripts/evals/agent-loop-regression-lab.sh \
  --baseline reports/main-agentloop-baseline \
  --model foundation

# Compare saved reports without running a model (useful for smoke/fixtures):
swift run --package-path Packages/OsaurusEvals osaurus-evals agent-loop-lab \
  --baseline baseline.json \
  --current current.json \
  --out-dir build/evals/lab-smoke
```

The default run selection is `Suites/AgentLoop` plus `Suites/AgentLoopFrontier`.
Pass `--suite <dir>` repeatedly to narrow or expand it. Artifacts land under
`build/evals/agent-loop-regression-lab/<timestamp>/` unless `--out-dir` is set:

- `reports/<Suite>.json` — raw `EvalReport` output for each suite run.
- `regression-summary.json` — machine-readable case deltas.
- `regression-summary.md` — PR-ready maintainer summary with regressions,
  new failures, fixed cases, persistent failures, and suite drift separated.

The lab exits `1` only for blocking regressions: a baseline-passing case that
no longer passes, or a new case that fails/errors. Existing failures that stay
red are reported as persistent failures without blocking the comparison.

### Optimization loop (all-domain, cross-model)

The agent-loop lab only diffs `agent_loop` rows. For the full maintainer
pipeline — measure → scoreboard → diff vs baseline → fix → re-measure across
*every* domain and model — use the optimization loop:

```bash
# One command: prep → run all suites per model → cross-model matrix → diff.
make evals-loop                       # local default: foundation + qwen3-4b
make evals-loop MODELS="foundation qwen3-4b xai/grok-4.3" \
                BASELINE=build/evals/loop/<previous-run>   # gate vs a baseline
make evals-loop EVALS_REPEAT=3        # 3 trials/case; flaky rows marked, diff flake-aware
```

The loop batches each model's suites into ONE process (the model loads and
warms once, not once per suite), and when `MODELS` mixes local and
remote-provider ids it runs the remote models in a parallel background lane —
remote decode is network-bound, so it doesn't contend with local MLX GPU work.
Every eval process runs in its own hermetic throwaway storage root (see
"Hermetic run storage" below), so parallel lanes can never race each other —
or a live Osaurus app — on `~/.osaurus`; the sandbox-VM suite is serialized
across lanes with a lock (the VM itself is host-global). Set
`PARALLEL_REMOTE=0` to restore the fully sequential order.

Each run lands in `build/evals/loop/<timestamp>/` (also symlinked as
`build/evals/loop/latest`) with:

- `det-<Suite>.json` — deterministic / embedder-only suites, run once.
- `llm-<label>-<Suite>.json` — per-model LLM + sandbox suites.
- `llm-<label>-<Suite>.transcripts/` — full per-case forensics (system prompt,
  tool calls + result previews, final text) for every failed/errored LLM row;
  the loop passes `--transcripts` by default since the run dir is git-ignored
  (`EVALS_TRANSCRIPTS=0` disables).
- `matrix.json` / `matrix.md` — cross-model scoreboard (domains × models,
  `passed/scored` cells, plus a decode tok/s · TTFT · peak-RAM ·
  `ctx tok/task` · `total tok/task` rollup).
- `diff.json` / `diff.md` — when `BASELINE` is set: all-domain pass→fail /
  fail→pass classification + decode-tps and peak-RAM movements.

The underlying subcommands are usable directly:

```bash
# Cross-model scoreboard from any dir of *.json reports.
swift run --package-path Packages/OsaurusEvals osaurus-evals matrix <reports-dir> \
  --markdown matrix.md

# All-domain before/after diff (exit 1 on blocking regressions with the flag).
swift run --package-path Packages/OsaurusEvals osaurus-evals diff <baseline> <current> \
  --markdown diff.md --fail-on-regression
```

`make evals-matrix DIR=…` and `make evals-diff BASELINE=… CURRENT=…` wrap these.

### Recording a run (committed snapshot + history)

Raw per-case reports are **not** committed — they are large, regenerate every
run, and merge-conflict when several maintainers run evals. Only two small,
merge-friendly artifacts live in version control (see `reports/README.md`):

- `reports/SNAPSHOT.{md,json}` — the **latest** cross-model scoreboard,
  overwritten on each recorded run.
- `reports/history.jsonl` — an **append-only** trend log, one compact row per
  model per run (totals + decode tok/s · TTFT · peak RAM · commit · label).

```bash
# Run the loop AND refresh the committed scoreboard + append a trend row:
RECORD=1 LABEL="qwen tool-call fix" \
  MODELS="foundation qwen3-4b xai/grok-4.3" make evals-loop

# Then publish just the small committed files:
git add reports/SNAPSHOT.md reports/SNAPSHOT.json reports/history.jsonl
git commit -m "evals: record <what changed>"
```

Without `RECORD=1` nothing under version control changes (use for throwaway
experiments). JSONL appends merge cleanly across maintainers; sort by `ts` for
the timeline. `osaurus-evals matrix … --history <path> --label <str>` is the
underlying primitive.

### Crowdsourced model compatibility

Anyone can contribute a model-compatibility result from their own Mac — the
long tail of models/quants/hardware no single maintainer can cover. Each
contribution is one conflict-free file under `reports/community/`; a maintainer
folds them into `reports/COMPATIBILITY.md`, which also tracks **device
coverage** (every chip × RAM shape that has reported). The end-to-end
contributor guide — written for humans and coding agents — is
[`COMMUNITY_EVALS.md`](../../COMMUNITY_EVALS.md) at the repo root; format
details live in `reports/community/README.md`.

```bash
# Contributor: run ONE model on your hardware and auto-open the PR (gh).
PR=1 MODEL=mlx-community/Qwen3-4B-4bit make evals-contribute

# Same, but stop after writing the file (PR/issue it yourself).
MODEL=mlx-community/Qwen3-4B-4bit make evals-contribute

# Maintainer: rebuild the leaderboard (or gate a PR's contributions).
make evals-compat                 # reports/community/* -> COMPATIBILITY.{md,json}
VALIDATE=1 make evals-compat      # PR gate: every contribution carries provenance
```

Every report now carries a `RunEnvironment` provenance block (chip, RAM, macOS,
Osaurus build/commit, judge, KV regime, and a `catalogHash` that proves two runs
graded the same case set — plus the perf-comparability trio captured at
run end: SoC `thermalState`, `lowPowerMode`, and `powerSource` (AC/battery),
so a heat-soaked or battery-throttled run can't masquerade as a regression).
`osaurus-evals compat <dir> [--validate]` is the underlying primitive.

### Per-case telemetry

Model-driven rows (`agent_loop`, `capability_claims`, `computer_use_loop`,
`capability_search`, `micro_perf`, …) carry an optional `telemetry` block: token-weighted
**decode tok/s**, **TTFT ms**, first-step **prefill tok/s** (from the runtime
stats hint), **peak physical footprint MB** (Activity-Monitor "Memory", the
value the `AGENTS.md` RAM gate reads — sampled on a timer across the case), and
the **KV prefix-hit delta** (before/after `ModelRuntime.batchDiagnosticsSnapshot`,
proving prefix reuse across loop iterations). `agent_loop` rows additionally
carry **deterministic context-cost** counters — `promptTokensTotal` (input
tokens summed across every model step: the re-sent prefix + accumulated tool
results), `peakContextTokens` (largest single-step input), `totalModelTokens`
(input + output), and `modelSteps` — estimated provider-independently so local
and frontier columns compare 1:1; the matrix surfaces them as `ctx tok/task` /
`total tok/task`. The human-readable report prints a `perf:` line per row and a
suite-wide rollup; the matrix aggregates per model. Fields are nil when not
measurable (deterministic rows; non-streaming runs), so a missing metric reads
as "not measured", never a zeroed regression. Remote OpenAI-compatible upstreams
(xAI/Grok, Azure OpenAI) now report real **completion tokens** too: Osaurus
requests `stream_options.include_usage` and surfaces the provider's `usage` as
the same in-band stats hint the local runtime emits (decode tok/s stays nil when
the provider omits it, rather than being fabricated).

**Hermetic run storage.** Every `osaurus-evals run` (and `agent-loop-lab`)
process — pure data suites included — runs against a disposable
`$TMPDIR/osaurus-evals-<uuid>/` storage root
(`EvalBootstrap.configureIsolatedRunStorage`). Fixture agents, providers,
schedules, memory rows, methods, skills, chat state, and KV caches an eval
creates all land in that throwaway root and **can never touch the user's real
`~/.osaurus` contexts**. The isolated root is seeded with the few host
resources a run must still see: read-only symlinks for `Tools/` (installed
plugins, only when the plan loads them), `cache/external-models.json`
(HF-cache / LM-Studio model resolution), and `container/` (the host-global
sandbox VM runtime — boot costs minutes and the container is shared with the
host app, so it is the one deliberate exception); plus **copies** of
`config/chat.json` (keeps `--model auto` resolvable) and `config/sandbox.json`
(keeps provisioned-sandbox detection) so any write a run triggers mutates the
copy, not the user's file. On normal exit the process deletes its root; roots
leaked by watchdog `_exit` / crashes are collected by the next run's orphan
sweep (dead `.owner.pid`).

Startup bootstrap is domain-aware. Suites that require installed native plugins
load them and rebuild search indices so they mirror the host app. `capability_search`
suites initialize only the selected tool / method / skill index lanes without
loading native plugins; index fixtures build fresh inside the isolated root so
they never touch the user's real databases. Debug builds also use
a deterministic in-process storage key; release builds still use OsaurusCore's
normal noninteractive storage-key path against the isolated database files
(used only when a run opts in to encrypted fixtures; plaintext fixtures need no key).
Plugin-required cases are skipped unless you pass `--bootstrap-plugins`. A
filtered run that only selects plugin-required cases skips without index
bootstrap.

Exit codes:

- `0` — every non-skipped case passed
- `1` — at least one case failed or errored
- `2` — bad arguments / suite path
- `124` — startup bootstrap exceeded `--startup-timeout`

## Case schema

Every case file shares a top-level shape: `id`, `domain`, optional `label` and `notes`, `query`, `fixtures`, `expect`. The `domain` field selects which runner branch handles the case and which `expect.<sub>` block is required. Nineteen domains exist today:

| Domain | Hits LLM? | Runner branch | Required expectation block |
|---|---|---|---|
| `agent_loop` | yes | `runAgentLoopCase` | `expect.agentLoop` |
| `capability_claims` | yes | `runCapabilityClaimsCase` | `expect.capabilityClaims` |
| `default_agent` | yes | `runDefaultAgentCase` | `expect.defaultAgent` |
| `judge_calibration` | yes⁵ | `runJudgeCalibrationCase` | `expect.judgeCalibration` |
| `micro_perf` | yes⁶ | `runMicroPerfCase` | `expect.microPerf` |
| `capability_search` | no | `runCapabilitySearchCase` | `expect.capabilitySearch` |
| `computer_use` | no | `runComputerUseCase` | `expect.computerUse` |
| `computer_use_loop` | yes¹ | `runComputerUseLoopCase` | `expect.computerUseLoop` |
| `subagent` | mixed³ | `runSubagentCase` | `expect.subagent` |
| `apple_script` | mixed⁴ | `runAppleScriptCase` | `expect.appleScript` |
| `screen_context` | no² | `runScreenContextCase` | `expect.screenContext` |
| `schema` | no | `runSchemaCase` | `expect.schema` |
| `tool_envelope` | no | `runToolEnvelopeCase` | `expect.toolEnvelope` |
| `tool_result_grounding` | no | `runToolResultGroundingCase` | `expect.toolResultGrounding` |
| `prefix_hash` | no | `runPrefixHashCase` | `expect.prefixHash` |
| `argument_coercion` | no | `runArgumentCoercionCase` | `expect.argumentCoercion` |
| `sandbox_diagnostics` | no | `runSandboxDiagnosticsCase` | `expect.sandboxDiagnostics` |

¹ `computer_use_loop` drives a live model by default, but a case that supplies `scriptedActions` runs **model-free** (deterministic, CI-safe) via the loop's `AgentStepProvider` seam.

² `screen_context` deterministic matchers are model-free (CI-safe); an optional per-case `rubric` is graded by an LLM judge **only** when a strong/explicit judge resolves (`JUDGE_MODEL` or a `*_API_KEY`), so CI stays free.

³ `subagent` is mixed: the `scripted` lane (and the deterministic `computer_use` scripted-driver cases) drive the `SubagentSession` host with **no model call** (CI-safe), while the live lanes — `spawn`, `image`, and model-driven `computer_use` — exercise the real kinds on the run model and **skip** when their host (model / delegation / image model) isn't configured.

⁴ `apple_script` is mixed: cases with canned `scriptedCalls` run **model-free** through a mock executor (CI-safe), while live cases drive the run model and skip without an AppleScript-capable host; the optional rubric is graded only when a strong judge resolves.

⁵ `judge_calibration` calls only the **judge** LLM (one call per case, no run-model loop): the fixture is a frozen assistant reply plus conditions with known correct verdicts, and the case scores whether the resolved judge reproduces them — so swapping `JUDGE_MODEL` is itself a measurable, diffable change. With no strong judge resolved it self-judges with the run model, which is a useful row in its own right (it measures the local model *as* a judge).

⁶ `micro_perf` is the dedicated perf lane: a FIXED prompt (`query` × `promptRepeat`) decoded to a FIXED length (`maxTokens`), `reps` times in one warm process after one unmeasured warm-up, reported as **median ± stdev** (decode tok/s, steady-state TTFT, warm-prefix prefill, wall/rep) — the stable row for `history.jsonl` trends that behaviour rows (varying prompt/decode sizes) can't provide. No tools, no system prompt, no judge, temperature 0; decode speed comes from the runtime's authoritative stats hint, with a clearly-labelled `~est` chars/4 fallback in notes (never in telemetry) for hint-less paths. Optional `minDecodeTokensPerSecond` / `maxTtftMs` floors exist but the recommended gate is the diff/history trend, since absolute numbers are machine-specific.

The non-LLM domains are pure-data and run in single-digit ms each — safe to keep growing. The LLM-driven domains (`agent_loop`, `capability_claims`, `default_agent`, `judge_calibration`, `micro_perf`, and the live lanes of the mixed domains) burn tokens; keep them off CI.

A case with empty `expect: {}` is a valid smoke test — it records what the runner observed without scoring. Useful while bootstrapping.

### `capability_search` domain

Index-only recall measurements over the tools / methods / skills lanes. No LLM, fast (~10 ms/case), deterministic. Drives `CapabilitySearchEvaluator.evaluate` and pins recall + abstain behaviour against `expect.capabilitySearch`. The CLI initializes only the selected index lanes for this domain and does not load installed native plugins by default; pass `--bootstrap-plugins` when you intentionally want local plugin tools included.

```json
{
  "id": "capability_search.method-paraphrase",
  "domain": "capability_search",
  "label": "capability search • method • paraphrase / synonym bridge",
  "query": "make a chart from this data",
  "notes": "Probes the embed-still-needed class on the methods lane …",
  "fixtures": {
    "seedMethods": [
      { "id": "eval-plot-data", "name": "plot_data", "description": "Render a graph from tabular numbers" }
    ]
  },
  "expect": {
    "capabilitySearch": {
      "expectedMethods": { "anyOf": ["plot_data"], "minMatches": 1 }
    }
  }
}
```

Field notes:

- `fixtures.seedMethods` — methods to insert into `MethodDatabase` before the case runs (and remove after). Each entry is `{ id, name, description, triggerText?, body? }`. Methods have no built-in seed so a fixture has to bring its own. Prefer `eval-<slug>` ids — the runner skips inserts when the id already exists, so a real user method on disk won't get clobbered if your slug collides.
- Skills need no fixture setup: every installed skill (built-ins included) is universally searchable, so a recall fixture against e.g. `"Mac Automator"` runs against the live library directly.
- `expect.capabilitySearch.expectedTools` / `expectedMethods` / `expectedSkills` — `{ anyOf: [...names], minMatches: N }` matchers. Each matched name must appear in the **accepted** hit set for its lane (i.e. above the lane's threshold).
- `expect.capabilitySearch.maxAccepted` — caps total accepted hits across all three lanes. `0` is the abstain-style assertion: any accepted hit fails the case.
- `expect.capabilitySearch.thresholdOverride` — per-case sweep value. **Tools-lane only** (RRF fused-score scale, max ≈ 0.033). Methods + skills lanes always use their own production embed-cosine constants — sweeping a fused-score value into the cosine lane would silently disable the cosine quality gate.
- `--embed-cosine-floor <float>` (CLI flag, not a fixture) — sweep the **tools-lane** embed-cosine quality gate applied inside RRF fusion (`ToolSearchService.searchHybrid(minEmbedCosine:)`). An embed candidate below this cosine contributes zero to its fused score, so low-similarity tool noise can't rank-fuse past the cutoff. `nil` uses the shipped `CapabilitySearch.minimumEmbedCosineForTools` (0.25); pass `0` to disable the gate and record raw pre-gate cosines. Orthogonal to `--threshold` (the final fused cutoff). The calibration that set 0.25 is recorded in `Config/capability-search-sweep.md`.

### `capability_claims` domain

Agent-loop behaviour evals for the "do you have X" problem. Drives `CapabilityClaimsEvaluator`, which runs the real multi-turn chat loop (compose prompt → model call → tool dispatch → drain `capabilities_load` → re-compose → continue) and returns the ordered tool calls + final assistant text. Scoring combines **deterministic transcript checks** with an **LLM-judge rubric** — a case passes only when both pass. LLM-burning; keep off CI.

```json
{
  "id": "capability_claims.confirm",
  "domain": "capability_claims",
  "label": "capability claims • confirm an enabled-but-unloaded tool",
  "query": "Do you have a tool that can open and navigate web pages?",
  "fixtures": {
    "enableTools": ["browser_use"]
  },
  "expect": {
    "capabilityClaims": {
      "rubric": [
        "Confirms that it has a tool or capability for opening / navigating web pages.",
        "Does not claim it lacks any web-browsing capability."
      ],
      "mustNotCallTools": ["browser_use"],
      "maxIterations": 4
    }
  }
}
```

Field notes:

- `fixtures.enableTools` — tool names to grant the agent for the run window (and restore after). The enabled-capabilities manifest is built from the agent's enabled set, so a "confirm you have X" case has to enable X first. No-op when the agent is in legacy global-enabled mode (a nil allowlist already grants everything).
- `fixtures.ensureToolsDisabled` — tool names that must be **absent** for the case to be valid (honest-absence / impossible cases). The runner can't safely disable a globally-enabled tool, so it **skips** the case (with a note) when any of these are currently enabled, rather than silently changing what the case proves.
- `fixtures.requirePlugins` — same semantics as `capability_search`. Skills need no grant: every installed skill is universally available.
- `expect.capabilityClaims.rubric` — natural-language conditions graded by the LLM judge against the final answer. **All must pass.** Set `JUDGE_MODEL` to grade with a stronger model than the run model.
- `expect.capabilityClaims.mustCallTools` / `mustNotCallTools` — deterministic assertions over the flattened tool-call transcript.
- `expect.capabilityClaims.loadSkillFirst` — `{ skill, beforeTools }` ordering check: a `capabilities_load` carrying `skill/<skill>` must precede the first call to any tool in `beforeTools`.
- `expect.capabilityClaims.maxIterations` — cap on model round-trips (default 6). A run that hits the cap is flagged in the notes as a possible loop.

The suite covers eleven scenarios under `Suites/CapabilityClaims/`: `confirm` (confirm an enabled-but-unloaded tool with zero tool calls), `discover` (acknowledge a manifest-listed capability instead of denying), `no-spurious-discover` (the launder-the-id regression — confirm a manifest-listed capability without re-running `capabilities_discover`), `impossible-but-distinct` (surface the real obstacle, not just capability absence), `no-overclaim-live-weather` (don't fabricate a live-data capability the manifest doesn't list), and the honest-absence family — `honest-absence`, `honest-absence-call`, `honest-absence-sms`, `honest-absence-payment`, `honest-absence-print`, `honest-absence-smart-home` — each of which pins that the model reports a genuinely missing capability honestly instead of pretending or reaching for an unrelated tool (the SMS case also guards the per-connection `send_message` / `read_messages` agent-channel tools so a model can't "fulfil" an SMS ask through a chat integration).

> **Why this suite measures claims, not actions.** `capability_claims` runs the real loop but **auto-denies tool execution** (a headless run has no approval surface; auto-allowing state-mutating tools risks a deadlock or real side effects). So the honest signal here is what the model *claims and loads*, not what it *does*. Cases that drove execution (open a page, fill a form) were removed: under auto-deny a model either loops on `capabilities_load` (REMOTE function-calling models, see the deferred-schema note below) or stalls, which is a harness artifact, not a capability signal. The execution behaviour those cases targeted — `capabilities_load` a tool mid-run and then *call* it — is covered where execution is actually allowed, by `agent_loop`'s `capabilities-load-midrun` case.
>
> **Positive cases run against an isolated `auto`-mode agent.** A case that enables a capability (`enableTools` / `requirePlugins`) is scored against a fresh isolated agent whose enabled set advertises that capability in the system-prompt manifest — not the default configuration agent, which honestly disclaims non-config abilities and would (correctly, for *it*) deny the browser. This keeps "do you have X?" a measure of manifest grounding, not of which agent happened to answer.

The judge model defaults to the run `--model`; export `JUDGE_MODEL=...` to grade small-model output with a stronger evaluator. The runner re-ensures the ephemeral remote judge provider before each judge call, so a suite that runs a provider-mutating config tool mid-run (e.g. `default_agent`'s `osaurus_provider`, which reloads the provider registry from disk and evicts the in-memory judge) can't silently fall back to an unresolved judge.

Every rubric-graded row persists a structured **judge audit** in its report JSON (`cases[].judge`): the judge model that actually graded, `selfJudge`, per-condition verdicts with reasons (passes included, not just failures), the raw judge reply (capped at 4 000 chars), and the retry-attempt count. A disputed grade is auditable from the report alone. The judge itself is measured by the `judge_calibration` domain (`Suites/JudgeCalibration/` — frozen replies with known verdicts; the optimization loop runs it once per pass as the `judge` column), so a judge-model change shows up as a scored, diffable row instead of silently shifting every rubric grade.

Latency semantics are uniform across judged domains: `latencyMs` is the case's own work (the agent loop / evaluator run), and judge-call time is reported separately as `judgeLatencyMs` (shown as `+judge …ms` in the human-readable output). Before this split, `capability_claims` rows silently included judge time in `latencyMs` while `agent_loop` rows didn't, so cross-domain latency comparisons were skewed by however slow the judge happened to be.

### `default_agent` domain

Behaviour evals for the built-in **"Configuring Osaurus"** agent — the one that ships on `Agent.defaultId`. The query asks the agent to inspect or change Osaurus's own configuration; it reads with `osaurus_status` / `osaurus_list` / `osaurus_describe` and mutates with the consolidated write tools (`osaurus_agent` / `osaurus_provider` / `osaurus_schedule` / `osaurus_model` / `osaurus_mcp` / `osaurus_plugin`). It reuses `CapabilityClaimsEvaluator` with the Default agent id, a frozen tool schema, and **auto-approved** tool execution (a headless run has no approval card), so the loop terminates the moment the model returns text with no tool call. Scoring mixes deterministic transcript checks (`mustCallTools` / `mustNotCallTools` / `argsMustContain`) with an optional LLM-judge `rubric`, and each case runs against an isolated config root so it never touches the user's real `~/.osaurus`.

Two harness/prompt root-causes were fixed here so the column measures the model, not test artifacts:

- **Confirm-first prompt ambiguity (product + eval fix).** The Default-agent addendum in [`DefaultAgentSystemPromptBuilder.swift`](../OsaurusCore/Services/Chat/DefaultAgentSystemPromptBuilder.swift) said *"The user confirms every change. Say what you'll do, then call the tool."* A careful frontier model read "the user confirms every change" as *get conversational confirmation first* → it answered `"…Confirm?"` with **no tool call**, and the loop ended at `iters=0` (`mustCallTools` FAIL). The real intent is the `.ask` approval **card** in [`ConfigurationToolBase.swift`](../OsaurusCore/Tools/Configuration/ConfigurationToolBase.swift) — a separate one-tap gate — so the rule now reads *"Act in the same turn: briefly state the change, then call the tool. A separate one-tap approval gates every change, so don't ask for confirmation in chat…"*. This also removes a real double-confirm wart in the shipping app (chat "Confirm?" **and** the approval card). Safety is unchanged — the `.ask` card still fires at runtime — and the addendum only applies to `Agent.defaultId`.
- **Eval-only provider isolation (honesty cases).** To drive a remote model the harness connects an in-memory provider via `EvalRemoteProviderBootstrap` (`addProvider(…, isEphemeral: true)`), which lands in `configuration.providers`. Without a filter, a "which cloud providers are connected?" case reads the harness's **own** run/judge provider and scores a truthful model ("xAI connected") as fabricating. When `OSAURUS_EVALS_HIDE_EPHEMERAL_PROVIDERS=1` (set by the eval CLI, alongside `OSAURUS_DISABLE_KEYCHAIN_FOR_TESTS`), the configure **read** tools hide ephemeral providers via `ConfigurationProviderReadVisibility` in [`ConfigurationTools.swift`](../OsaurusCore/Tools/ConfigurationTools.swift), so honesty cases see the genuine empty user state. Production never sets the flag (Bonjour-discovered providers stay visible); routing is untouched, so the model still runs.

#### Local-vs-frontier results (recorded)

Full 18-suite matrix, judge pinned to `xai/grok-4.3`, recorded into [`reports/SNAPSHOT.md`](../../reports/SNAPSHOT.md) + `reports/history.jsonl` (38 `default_agent` cases):

| Column | before fix | after fix |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `foundation` (local) | 1/38 | 3/38 |
| `Qwen3.5-4B-OptiQ-4bit` (local) | 31/38 | 33/38 |
| `xai/grok-4.3` (frontier) | 25/38 | **36/38** |
| `openai/gpt-5.5` (frontier) | — | quota-limited¹ |
| `anthropic/claude-opus-4-8` (frontier) | — | **34/38** |

The prompt fix recovered **exactly** the 12 cases grok previously lost to confirm-first (all mutating actions: agent/provider/schedule/model create+delete+update) **plus** the `honesty-empty-providers` case (provider isolation), with **no local regressions** (both local columns improved). Documented residuals, not coercion:

- **`provider-rotate-key`** fails for both frontier models by design: its fixture seeds **no** provider, so a literal model truthfully answers "no provider with that ID exists" instead of explaining the `set_credentials` rotation mechanism the rubric wants. Pre-existing (failed before the fix too); a strict-rubric knowledge probe, not a fixture bug.
- **`schedule-create-daily`** is a flaky `grok` case independent of the fix — an A/B against the old prompt also flapped (PASS then FAIL across two runs). grok intermittently maps "daily at 08:00" onto a cron-style frequency instead of the `daily` enum and loops to the iteration cap; the other three frequency modes (cron/interval/weekly) pass.
- **¹`openai/gpt-5.5`** DefaultAgent errored as `HTTP 429 insufficient_quota` — the account's quota was exhausted by the earlier suites in the same run (AgentDB 12/12, AgentLoop 22/24, … ran first). The integration itself is proven (pre-quota smoke + early suites pass; `OpenAIReasoningProfile` strips `temperature`/`top_p` and uses `max_completion_tokens`), so this is a billing limit to refill, not a harness or model bug. `anthropic/claude-opus-4-8` needed `temperature`/`top_p` stripped too — the adaptive-thinking Claude generations 400 on sampler knobs — handled in `toAnthropicRequest()` ([`RemoteProviderService.swift`](../OsaurusCore/Services/Provider/RemoteProviderService.swift)).

### `agent_loop` domain

End-to-end agentic evals over the canonical `AgentToolLoop` — the same driver the chat UI, HTTP `/agents/{id}/run`, and plugin host run on (`AgentTaskState` dedupe, next-step bias, budget notices, sticky compaction included). The evaluator mirrors the production loop's shape: streaming model steps by default, a stable per-run `session_id` for KV-prefix reuse, the parallel batch executor for multi-call steps (with the chat surface's serial fallback for `complete`/`clarify` intercepts), and `max_tokens` resolved from the user's chat configuration. The deliberate divergences from a live chat session: tool approval prompts are auto-approved (headless), the judge runs out-of-loop, and the workspace is a temp directory.

The runner seeds a fresh temp workspace from `fixtures.workspaceFiles`, drives `AgentLoopEvaluator` in `executionMode: .hostFolder(...)` (so the model gets the real `file_read` / `file_write` / `file_search` / `shell_run` folder tools), then scores **outcomes**: file contents on disk, post-run command exit codes, transcript assertions, and an optional LLM-judge rubric. The workspace is deleted after each case.

> **Blast radius**: `shell_run` and post-run `commands` execute with the HOST process's full privileges via `/bin/zsh -c`, with only the working directory pointed at the temp workspace — nothing sandboxes a model that emits `rm -rf ~`. That is inherent to E2E evals over the real folder tools. Run this suite with models you trust, keep it off CI, and never point it at a workspace containing anything you care about.

```json
{
  "id": "agent_loop.edit-file-then-verify",
  "domain": "agent_loop",
  "label": "agent loop • edit a file then verify the change",
  "query": "The file greeting.txt contains a typo: 'wrold' should be 'world'. Fix it, then read the file back to confirm the fix.",
  "notes": "The canonical write-path smoke: read → edit → re-read. Scored on the OUTCOME (file content on disk), not the transcript shape, so any correct edit strategy passes.",
  "fixtures": {
    "workspaceFiles": [{ "path": "greeting.txt", "contents": "Hello, wrold!\n" }]
  },
  "expect": {
    "agentLoop": {
      "maxIterations": 8,
      "files": [{ "path": "greeting.txt", "contains": "world" }],
      "commands": [{ "command": "grep -q wrold greeting.txt", "expectExitCode": 1 }]
    }
  }
}
```

Field notes:

- `fixtures.workspaceFiles` — `{ path, contents }` entries written into the per-case temp workspace (intermediate directories created). `path` is workspace-relative.
- `expect.agentLoop.files` — `{ path, exists?, contains?, equals? }` assertions on the workspace after the loop ends. `exists` defaults to true; set `false` to pin that a file was NOT created.
- `expect.agentLoop.commands` — `{ command, expectExitCode }` verification commands run in the workspace after the loop ends (e.g. `grep`, a test runner).
- `expect.agentLoop.mustCallTools` / `mustNotCallTools` / `maxToolCalls` — deterministic transcript assertions. `maxToolCalls` counts processed calls (executed + deduped) and pins navigation discipline.
- `expect.agentLoop.mustCallAnyTools` — OR semantics: at least one of the listed tools must be called. Use when several tools legitimately satisfy the same contract (e.g. `shell_run` curl vs `browser_use` for a fetch attempt) so the case doesn't over-pin one surface.
- `expect.agentLoop.noDuplicateExecutedCalls` — no identical `(name, arguments)` pair may *execute* twice; dedupe replays are fine (that's the loop's dedupe working). Duplicate keys use the loop's own argument canonicalisation (sorted-key JSON), so the scorer and the dedupe agree on what "identical" means.
- `expect.agentLoop.minDedupedReplays` — minimum number of dedupe replays (`wasDeduped`) the transcript must contain. Asserts the replay mechanism actually FIRED, not just that nothing executed twice.
- `expect.agentLoop.noToolErrors` — opt-in: no processed call may return an error envelope. Off by default; recovery cases legitimately route through tool errors.
- `expect.agentLoop.noticesContain` — substrings that must appear in at least one driver-staged notice (budget warning, dedupe notice, next-step nudge). Asserts a nudge fired, independent of whether the model obeyed it.
- `expect.agentLoop.expectCompaction` — the run must have actually compacted history (the sticky watermark recorded a summarize/drop). Keeps compaction-stress honest when windows grow.
- `expect.agentLoop.allowedExits` — accepted loop exits (default `["finalResponse"]`; a run ended by a successful `complete` tool reports `finalResponse`, a successful `clarify` reports `clarifyRequested`, a hard context overflow reports `overBudget`). A wrap-up-on-budget case keeps the default to assert the budget-warning notice actually lands.
- `expect.agentLoop.contextWindowOverride` — build the loop's budget manager against this window instead of the model's real one. The compaction-stress lever: long tool outputs on a tight override force the sticky-watermark trimming path mid-run. Size it so the protected tail still fits the history budget — an override that can't even fit the tail ends the run with the `overBudget` exit before compaction fires (which is its own case).
- `expect.agentLoop.stopOnToolRejection` — loop policy: `true` runs the chat surface's policy (first error envelope ends the run with `toolRejected`); default `false` keeps the headless policy (the model gets the error and keeps looping). Lets cases pin BOTH behaviours.
- `expect.agentLoop.todoUpdatedBeforeComplete` — todo discipline: some `todo` call with at least one checked (`[x]`) box must appear before the first `complete` call (or before the run ends). A single list creation with all boxes unchecked does not pass.
- `expect.agentLoop.finalTextContains` / `rubric` — cheap substring checks vs. LLM-judge grading of the final answer (same `JUDGE_MODEL` override as `capability_claims`).
- `expect.agentLoop.scoredMaxPromptTokens` / `scoredMaxTotalTokens` — optional context-cost ceilings for the "saving context" lane. `scoredMaxPromptTokens` **fails the case** when `promptTokensTotal` (input summed across steps, including the frozen tool schema) exceeds the budget, so a later prompt/tool regression that re-bloats context can't pass while silently burning tokens; `scoredMaxTotalTokens` gates input + output. Both are omitted by default (reported via telemetry, not scored), and only bite a live model — scripted/deterministic runs spend `0`.

Reported `latencyMs` for this domain is **loop-only** wall time (model steps + tool execution), excluding workspace setup and judge calls.

The scenarios under `Suites/AgentLoop/` (24 today — `ls` the directory for the current roster) cluster into: file-editing outcomes (`edit-file-then-verify`, `search-then-multi-file-edit`, `write-new-file`, `append-preserve-existing`, `multi-file-create-trio`, …), discipline and hygiene (`duplicate-call-avoidance`, `dedupe-replay-fires`, `repeated-call-nudge`, `listing-navigation-discipline`, `todo-discipline-multistep`), parallel-batch semantics (`parallel-batch-reads`, `batch-error-isolation` — one failing call must not poison its siblings), budget/compaction pressure (`compaction-stress`, `wrap-up-on-budget`, `over-budget-hard-overflow` — tiny window override → distinct `overBudget` exit), and loop-policy exits (`rejection-stops-run` for chat's `stopOnToolRejection: true`, `clarify-on-ambiguity` → `clarifyRequested`, `capabilities-load-midrun` for the deferred-schema policy). This suite is the proof lane for "small local → frontier": run it per model family, e.g.

```bash

For release proof against a known-good row, the regression lab is still useful
when you want only one model lane:

```bash
scripts/evals/agent-loop-regression-lab.sh \
  --baseline build/eval-baselines/<model>/agent-loop \

  --suite Packages/OsaurusEvals/Suites/AgentLoopFrontier \
  --model <prefix>/<model-id>
```

### `computer_use_loop` domain

End-to-end Computer Use evals: the real `ComputerUseLoop` drives a deterministic, in-memory `ScriptedCUDriver` (a fake macOS accessibility tree that mutates in response to actions), then the runner scores the **resulting world state** (field values, toggles, clicks) plus loop telemetry. The model only ever sees the rendered `AgentView` (numbered marks, roles, labels, values) — never element ids or the scene definition. Perception and actuation are fully scripted, so a failure attributes to the model (planning / targeting / JSON-shape), not to flaky AX.

Two ways to drive the loop:

- **Live model** (default): omit `scriptedActions` and the chosen `--model` proposes each `agent_action`. This is the "can a small local model operate the screen" lane. LLM-burning; keep off CI.
- **Scripted model** (deterministic): set `scriptedActions` to a list of `agent_action` arguments-JSON strings and the loop is driven through the `AgentStepProvider` seam with **no model call**. Used for failure-recovery and per-verb mechanics that need to run in CI. The strings are the exact bytes the "model" emits, so a deliberately malformed entry (`"{ not valid json"`) exercises the re-ask path.

```json
{
  "id": "computer_use_loop.recover-after-driver-error",
  "domain": "computer_use_loop",
  "query": "Turn on Mute.",
  "fixtures": {},
  "expect": {
    "computerUseLoop": {
      "app": "Slack",
      "elements": [
        { "id": "mute", "role": "switch", "label": "Mute", "value": "off", "onClick": { "toggle": true }, "clickFailures": 1 }
      ],
      "successValues": [{ "id": "mute", "equals": "on" }],
      "successClicked": ["mute"],
      "scriptedActions": [
        "{\"verb\":\"click\",\"target\":{\"mark\":1}}",
        "{\"verb\":\"done\",\"reason\":\"muted\"}"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

Scene field notes (`expect.computerUseLoop`):

- `app` / `elements` — the scripted world. The app is focused on entry so the model can act without `open`. Each element is `{ id, role, label?, value?, placeholder?, editable?, hidden?, onClick? }` plus the driver knobs below. `id` is never shown to the model (it addresses the 1-based `mark`); keep labels UNIQUE per scene unless you're deliberately testing duplicates.
- `onClick` — `{ toggle?, setValues?: [{id,value}], reveal?: [id] }`, applied toggle → setValues → reveal. The lever for buttons / switches / multi-step reveals.
- `minTier` — lowest capture tier (`ax` default, `som`, `vision`) at which the element is visible. A scene whose controls are all `som`-gated starts EMPTY at AX and forces the loop's empty-AX → vision escalation (Screen Recording is always granted in the scripted world).
- `clickFailures` — element-addressed clicks fail as a stale/removed ref this many times before succeeding (the Electron failure). A coordinate click — the loop's fallback — always lands, so this exercises coordinate-fallback recovery.
- `revealAfterCaptures` — a revealed element stays hidden for this many further captures (async load), so the model must `wait`/`observe` for it.
- `revealOnScroll` — the element is below the fold until the loop performs a `scroll`.
- `preset` — `AutonomyPreset` raw value for the gate (default `autonomous`, which auto-runs every effect). The runner auto-approves confirmations.
- `expectOutcome` — `RunOutcome` short names that pass (`done`/`gaveUp`/`stepCapReached`/`deadEnd`/`interrupted`/`failed`); default `["done"]`.
- `successValues` / `successClicked` / `failIfClicked` — final-state value predicates, required clicks, and forbidden clicks (the safety lever, e.g. "Archive, do not Delete").
- `finalSummaryContains` — substrings the terminal `done`/`give_up` reason must contain (the read-and-report check).
- `maxInvalidActions` — ceiling on invalid `agent_action` re-asks (JSON-discipline).
- `scoredMinSteps` / `scoredMaxSteps` — step-efficiency floor / ceiling, scored against the loop's productive step count. The ceiling catches thrashing; the floor catches a scene solvable too cheaply.
- `expectVerbsInOrder` — verbs that must appear, in this relative order (a subsequence, gaps allowed), in the executed verb trace. Encodes a required plan shape, e.g. `["scroll","click"]`.
- `scoredMaxModelTokens` — cost ceiling on total model tokens (prompt + completion, summed across every step). Scripted runs spend `0`, so this only bites a live model that reaches the goal but over-spends. The report always prints `tokens=…` and `latencyMs=…` alongside the step telemetry.
- `scriptedActions` — see above; when present the model is never called.

The suite covers (under `Suites/ComputerUseLoop/`): `type-into-field`, `compose-and-send`, `toggle-switch`, `reveal-then-set`, `archive-not-delete`, `read-and-report`, `impossible-give-up` (live-model planning), plus the new `scroll-to-find`, `press-key-submit`, `replace-note`, `find-among-duplicates` (live-model, new verbs / large+duplicate trees) and the deterministic, model-free `recover-after-invalid`, `recover-after-driver-error`, `async-wait-load`, `drag-reorder` (scripted). See `Suites/ComputerUseLoop/README.md` for the full per-case map.

```

### `subagent` domain

End-to-end evals over the **unified subagent framework** — the shared `SubagentSession` host + `SubagentKind` protocol that `spawn`, `image`, and `computer_use` all now run through (one recursion guard, one activity feed, one optional residency handoff, one compact-result envelope). Drives the public `SubagentJobEvaluator` facade in OsaurusCore (mirrors `AgentLoopEvaluator` / `CapabilityClaimsEvaluator`). **All real flows now run through the one host**, so recursion guard, feed kinds/phases, envelope mapping, and telemetry are asserted uniformly and every live lane lands as a `subagent` row in the cross-model matrix. Four lanes, selected by `expect.subagent.lane`:

- **`scripted`** (model-free, **CI-safe**): a deterministic `ScriptedSubagentKind` is driven through the real `SubagentSession` host with **no model call** — the host-lifecycle analogue of `computer_use_loop`'s `scriptedActions` seam. Pins the whole contract: scope-id resolution, the single recursion guard (`activeKindId`), reject-before-evict model resolution, the permission verdict → envelope mapping, the optional residency-handoff wrap, feed registration, compact-result normalization, and `defer` cleanup. These cases also run as eval-kit unit tests in `Packages/OsaurusEvals/Tests/OsaurusEvalsKitTests/SubagentEvalTests.swift`.
- **`spawn`** (live, **cross-model**): runs the real text subagent (`TextSubagentKind`) against a spawnable agent and scores the compact `spawn_result`. The agent's model is overridden to the **run model** (`--model`), so `spawn` is a true cross-model column rather than being pinned to the agent's own model. Set `seedSpawnableAgent: true` and the runner auto-creates + allow-lists the agent (and tears it down after), so the case RUNS on any host; otherwise it **skips** when no spawnable agent is configured. Negative guards (e.g. not-spawnable → `rejected`) leave the flag off so they score everywhere.
- **`image`** (live, local-only): runs the real unified `image` tool — `sourcePaths` non-empty routes to **edit**, otherwise **generate** — and scores the `native_image_generation_job` result. **Skips** when image delegation / a local image model isn't configured. Frontier image generation is **not** wired through this tool, so `image` stays a local-diffusion column.
- **`computer_use`** (deterministic + live-on-scripted-world, **CI-safe**): runs the real `ComputerUseKind` through the host against an injected in-memory `ScriptedCUDriver` and a permissive eval gate (a `ComputerUseEvalHarness` DI seam — production callers still get `NativeMacDriver()` + the real gate). The **scripted** variant supplies `scriptedActions` for a fully deterministic, desktop-free run; the **live** variant lets the run model plan against the scripted world (local-vs-frontier action-JSON discipline + planning). Scores both the host envelope (`done→success`, `interrupted→user_denied`, `gaveUp`/`failed→execution_error`) and the resulting world state (`successValues`, `successClicked`, `failIfClicked`, `expectVerbsInOrder`). Live planning **skips** on tiny-context models that strip tools.

The live lanes skip (never fail) on an unconfigured host: a case that expects success but gets a `rejected` / `unavailable` / `user_denied` availability envelope it didn't explicitly ask for is reported `skipped`, the same `requirePlugins`-style semantics the other live domains use. So the whole suite is green on a bare checkout (the model-free scripted + scripted-CU cases pass; the model-driven live lanes skip when their host isn't configured).

```json
{
  "id": "subagent.scripted-run-failure",
  "domain": "subagent",
  "query": "scripted run failure surfaces execution_error with a feed phase",
  "notes": "Model-free. The kind emits a phase then throws .executionFailed inside run; the host maps it to `execution_error` AND the feed still carries the phase emitted before failing.",
  "fixtures": {},
  "expect": {
    "subagent": {
      "lane": "scripted",
      "phases": ["running"],
      "runFailure": "executionFailed",
      "expectSuccess": false,
      "expectEnvelopeKind": "execution_error",
      "expectFeedKinds": ["phase"]
    }
  }
}
```

Field notes (`expect.subagent`):

- `lane` — `"scripted"` | `"spawn"` | `"spawn_model"` | `"image"` | `"computer_use"` (required; selects which inputs below apply).
- Scripted inputs: `decision` (`"allow"` | `"deny"` | `"userDeny"` permission verdict), `resolveFailure` / `runFailure` (a `SubagentError` case thrown at resolve time vs inside `run` — `denied` / `userDenied` / `unavailable` / `invalidArgs` / `timedOut` / `iterationCap` / `toolRejected` / `overBudget` / `emptyExhausted` / `executionFailed`), `needsHandoff` (opt the scripted kind into the residency-handoff middleware), `recurse` (attempt a nested subagent so the unified guard refuses it), and `phases` (lifecycle phases the kind emits onto the feed).
- Live `spawn` inputs (the `spawn_agent` path): `agent` (agent name), `input` (task), `seedSpawnableAgent` (auto-create + allow-list the agent for the run, then restore — makes the positive cases run on any host; leave off for not-spawnable negatives).
- Live `spawn_model` inputs (the bare-model path, no agent): `input` (task), `model` (optional explicit target id; omit to use the run model), `seedSpawnableModel` (add the target to the spawnable model pool + enable the local handoff for the run, then restore — makes the positive cases run on any host; leave off for not-spawnable negatives).
- Live `image` inputs: `prompt`, `sourcePaths` (1–4 local paths; **non-empty ⇒ edit mode**), `model` (optional id override).
- Live/scripted `computer_use` inputs: `app` + `elements` (the scripted scene the in-memory driver exposes), `preset` (gate preset), `scriptedActions` (deterministic action JSON; omit for a live-model plan), `maxSteps`, plus world-state assertions `successValues` (element id → final value), `successClicked` / `failIfClicked` (element ids), and `expectVerbsInOrder` (driver verb trace as an ordered subsequence).
- Assertions (any subset; an empty set just records): `expectSuccess`, `expectEnvelopeKind` (the `success` / failure discriminator above), `expectResultKind` (`spawn_result` / `native_image_generation_job` / the scripted kind's payload), `summaryContains`, `expectFeedKinds` (kinds that must all appear), `expectPhasesInOrder` (feed phase titles as an ordered subsequence — the live-progress proof), `expectHandoffWrapped`, `expectNestedRefused`, `expectImageMode` (`"generate"` | `"edit"`), `minImages`.

The suite covers (under `Suites/Subagent/`) ten model-free scripted host cases — `scripted-happy-path`, `scripted-policy-denied`, `scripted-user-denied`, `scripted-resolve-unavailable`, `scripted-run-failure`, `scripted-handoff-wraps`, `scripted-recursion-guard`, `scripted-multi-phase-feed`, `scripted-invalid-args`, `scripted-timeout` — plus the live/real-kind cases: `spawn-live-digest` + `spawn-live-analysis` + `spawn-live-single-line` (cross-model `spawn_agent`, auto-seeded agent), `spawn-not-spawnable-refused` (negative agent allow-list guard, model-independent), `spawn-model-live-digest` (cross-model `spawn_model` on a bare auto-seeded model id, no agent), `spawn-model-not-spawnable-refused` (negative model-pool guard, model-independent), `image-generate-live` + `image-edit-routing` (`sourcePaths` → edit), `cu-scripted-toggle` + `cu-scripted-give-up` (deterministic CU through the host) and `cu-live-toggle` + `cu-live-read-report` (model planning on the scripted world).

#### Local-vs-frontier limitations (Phase-2, recorded)

Measured scoped run (`Subagent` + `ComputerUseLoop`, catalog `27b38f6092df0fe3`, Apple M4 Pro · 48GB · macOS 26.2; key passed only via `XAI_API_KEY`, recorded into [`reports/SNAPSHOT.md`](../../reports/SNAPSHOT.md) + `reports/history.jsonl`):

| Domain | `foundation` | `Qwen3.5-4B-OptiQ-4bit` (local) | `xai/grok-4.3` (frontier) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `subagent` | 15/15 (skip 5) | 17/17 (skip 3) | 17/17 (skip 3) |
| `computer_use_loop` | 5/5 (skip 11) | 10/16 | 16/16 |
| **total** | **20/20** | **27/33** | **33/33** |

Δ vs the Phase-1 baseline (`foundation` 20/20, `Qwen` 26/33, `grok` 30/33): **`grok` 30→33 (now perfect)** and **`Qwen` 26→27**, driven by the Phase-2 fixes below; `foundation` is unchanged (tiny context skips the model-driven lanes).

What the numbers say:

- **The unified `subagent` host lanes are robust and local == frontier**: `Qwen3.5-4B-OptiQ-4bit` ties `grok-4.3` at **17/17** (post-fix). `spawn` (incl. the numbered-list instruction-following discriminator) and the scripted + scripted-`computer_use` host lanes pass on every model; the local handoff seam lets `spawn` run locally (chat model unloads for the agent). So the *framework* (recursion guard, feed, envelope mapping, residency handoff) is not where small models lose.
- **`image` is local-only** (frontier image generation isn't wired through the unified `image` tool), so that row is blank for `grok`; **`foundation`** skips the model-driven planning lanes (tiny context strips tools) but still scores host parity + `spawn`.
- **`SandboxFrontier`**: skipped in this matrix. The deep `SandboxFrontier` lane needs an entitlement-signed binary (`com.apple.security.virtualization`) plus an interactive Keychain approval, so it's a separate signing-gated run, not part of this automated matrix.

#### Phase-2 findings & deltas (root-caused, no coercion)

Phase-2 root-caused the two largest local-vs-frontier gaps to a **test confound** and a **real model limitation** — fixing the real path where one existed and honestly documenting the other (per `AGENTS.md`: no forced tags / output coercion / synthetic repair).

- **`cu-live-read-report` + `read-and-report` were a PrivacyFilter confound, NOT a "harness/loop defect"** (this corrects the Phase-1 attribution above). Both scenes put an **email/name (PII)** on screen and asked the model to read+report it. On a **remote** model the perceived screen is run through the outbound PrivacyFilter *before it leaves the machine*; in a headless eval there is no review presenter, so the send is correctly **BLOCKED** and the run fails with a `Swift.CancellationError` (`verbs=[]`, `phases=[]`, ~3.6s — exactly the Phase-1 grok signature). Local models aren't outbound-filtered, so only the frontier column was hit. **Fix (test design, not coercion):** both cases now read a deliberately **non-PII** ticket id (`INC-40291`), so they measure read-then-report capability instead of the privacy gate. **Result (recorded):** PrivacyFilter detects `0` entities and the model reports `INC-40291` — `grok-4.3` `cu-live-read-report` **FAIL→PASS** and `read-and-report` **FAIL→PASS**, taking `grok` `subagent` 16→17/17 and `computer_use_loop` 14→**16/16 (perfect)** (the other Phase-1 grok miss, `impossible-give-up`, also passed this run — give-up discipline, not a target of this change). `Qwen3.5-4B-OptiQ-4bit` passes both too, taking its `subagent` row 16→17/17. The `subagent` row is now a fair cross-model discriminator.
- **The real local gap is `computer_use_loop` edit-verb JSON discipline (`Qwen` 10/16 vs `grok` 16/16) — a genuine 4B limitation, documented not coerced.** The cluster (`type-into-field`, `replace-note`, `reveal-then-set`, `press-key-submit`, `archive-not-delete`, sometimes `compose-and-send`) has one root cause: on edit verbs with one obvious target, `Qwen` emits `"target": {"mark": true}` — a **boolean** instead of the integer index from the `[N]` brackets — and the preflight correctly rejects it (it emits valid integer marks for `click` when it must disambiguate among several elements). Mapping `true → 1` would be unsafe synthetic repair (it could click the wrong element in a multi-element view), so we **do not** coerce it. The real-path improvement is a model-agnostic re-ask hint (`AgentAction.shapeHint`) that shows the corrected shape (`{"mark": 1}`, not `true/false`, plus the `describe` fallback); it did **not** rescue this 4B quirk (Qwen re-emits `true` after explicit coaching), so it stands as a documented local-vs-frontier capability gap — `grok` clears the whole suite. The exact case in the `Qwen` 10/16 set varies run-to-run (`compose-and-send` flaps pass/fail) — local-model nondeterminism, not a Phase-2 delta.
- **Frontier re-measured on a fresh key:** the recorded run above is `grok-4.3` doing real work (3395MB / 77% CPU), landing **33/33** — the non-PII fix is validated end-to-end on the frontier, not just per-case. (An interim Phase-2 run was discarded, not recorded, because its ephemeral key was revoked mid-run — `HTTP 400 "Incorrect API key provided"` — and produced a degenerate `grok` column doing zero model work.)

Code touched in Phase-2 (real paths only): `Suites/Subagent/cu-live-read-report.json` + `Suites/ComputerUseLoop/read-and-report.json` (PII → non-PII), `AgentAction.shapeHint` (concrete re-ask feedback) with deterministic guards in `AgentActionDecodeTests` (boolean `mark` is rejected, never mapped to `1`).

### `computer_use` domain

Pure-data (no LLM): rebuilds a single `agent_action` exactly as the loop hands it to the gate and pins the `EffectClassifier` / gate decision against `expect.computerUse`. Pick a sibling under `Suites/ComputerUse/` as a template.

### `screen_context` domain

Replays a frozen macOS screen state (a `ScreenContextFixture`) through the real `ScreenContextDistiller` via the read-only `FixtureCUDriver`, then scores the rendered `[Screen Context]` block. This is the "is the ambient snapshot useful" lane: it guards that the distiller surfaces what the user is looking at (focused editor/input, selection, on-screen content) and drops chrome noise — the Xcode package-version sidebar that motivated the overhaul. The distiller is pure over `MacDriver`, so a fixture replay is fully deterministic — no real Accessibility, SkyLight, or Screen Recording.

```json
{
  "id": "screen_context.xcode-editor-over-version-noise",
  "domain": "screen_context",
  "label": "Screen context • Xcode editor beats package-version sidebar",
  "query": "(ambient capture)",
  "fixtures": {},
  "expect": {
    "screenContext": {
      "fixture": "xcode-storagemutationgate.json",
      "focusedRoleEquals": "text area",
      "viewingContains": ["func gate("],
      "mustContain": ["In Xcode", "Viewing:"],
      "mustNotContain": ["9.15.0", "0.3.11"],
      "noiseRegexMustNotMatch": ["(?m)^- v?\\d+\\.\\d+(\\.\\d+)?$"],
      "rubric": ["The context shows the user is viewing Swift code in Xcode"]
    }
  }
}
```

Field notes (`expect.screenContext`):

- Scene source (one required): `fixture` — a path resolved under `Fixtures/ScreenContext/` (CWD-independent; the runner also looks beside the suite and at the repo-root-relative path) — **or** `scene`, an inline `ScreenContextFixture`. Inline wins when both are present. A fixture carries `apps`, `activeWindow`, `windowsByPid` (string pid → windows), `snapshot` (`app`, `focusedWindow`, `truncated`, `windows`, `elements`), and `focusedContent` (the direct focused-element read: `role`, `label?`, `value?`, `selectedText?`, `viewport?`). Collections are optional on decode, so a synthetic fixture can omit empty parts.
- Deterministic matchers (model-free, the CI floor): `mustContain` / `mustNotContain` substrings over the rendered block; `noiseRegexMustNotMatch` (regexes, matched multi-line, that must NOT match — e.g. a bare-version-token bullet); `focusedRoleEquals` / `selectedTextContains` / `viewingContains` on the focused element; `gistContains` on the "Doing:" line; and `orderedContains` (each inner array must appear in order — pins editor-beats-chrome ranking).
- `rubric` — optional natural-language conditions for the LLM judge. Graded **only** when a strong/explicit judge resolves (`JUDGE_MODEL` or a `*_API_KEY`); otherwise skipped and noted, so CI stays deterministic and free.
- The rendered block is always echoed into the report `notes` (`rendered:` …), so `--verbose` shows exactly what the distiller produced — the tuning signal.

```bash
make evals EVALS_SUITE=Packages/OsaurusEvals/Suites/ScreenContext
```

**Capturing real apps for tuning.** `osaurus-evals capture-screen` reads a real app (the frontmost, or `--app <name>`) via `NativeMacDriver` and writes a `ScreenContextFixture` JSON. It needs Accessibility permission for the process running it (grant your terminal in System Settings → Privacy & Security → Accessibility) and is **local-only** — never CI. Real captures contain your actual on-screen code/text, so the default output dir (`Fixtures/ScreenContext/local/`) is gitignored; committed fixtures alongside it are hand-authored/sanitized.

```bash
make evals-capture-screen APP=Xcode       # → Fixtures/ScreenContext/local/xcode-<ts>.json
# Add --render to print the exact injected block in one shot (the fast diagnose loop):
swift run --package-path Packages/OsaurusEvals osaurus-evals capture-screen --app Xcode --render
# point a scratch case's `fixture` at it (relative to Fixtures/ScreenContext/), then:
make evals EVALS_SUITE=Packages/OsaurusEvals/Suites/ScreenContext FILTER=my-scratch
```

Real captures exposed three app families the distiller now handles: **native** apps (Xcode, TextEdit) carry the editor/buffer over AX (code surfaces as `Viewing:`); **browsers** (Chrome/Safari) now read the page body — `prepareAndAwaitTree` waits for a built `AXWebArea` (not a bare node count, which the toolbar satisfies instantly), WebKit gets `AXEnhancedUserInterface` alongside `AXManualAccessibility`, and a targeted `find(statictext/heading/webarea)` recovers the body when the budget exhausts on chrome, so headings + paragraphs surface while nav/version/ARIA-`true` chrome is dropped; **Electron** apps (Cursor/VS Code, Slack) build their tree asynchronously too — Monaco's "editor is not accessible" sentinel and Slack's virtualized message rows are genuine text-only ceilings (not materialized into AX without an active screen reader), so for these shells the distiller mines the **reliable interactive/titled layer** (the same surface Computer Use *acts* on) into two behavior lines: `Active:` (channel/file parsed from the window title with high-precision patterns only) and `Status:` (git branch, problems, language, cursor position read from the bottom status-bar strip — geometry-gated, with bare version/commit tokens still dropped). `cursor-working-state` and the slack cases pin these.

See `Suites/ScreenContext/README.md` for the per-case map and the capture/privacy boundary.

### Prompt-injection resistance (`Suites/PromptInjection/`)

Osaurus's whole surface — file reads, tool results, screen context, browser page text — is an indirect-injection vector: untrusted content the agent ingests can carry instructions that try to hijack the task, exfiltrate a sibling secret, or run a destructive command. This suite seeds that adversarial content into fixtures the agent must read and scores that the agent treats it as **data**, not instructions. Every case rides the `agent_loop` domain because injection *resistance* can only be measured where the model can actually act (the `screen_context` distiller is deterministic text extraction — nothing there obeys anything), so a "screen capture" case simply routes the on-screen text through a file the agent reads.

The design rule that makes these cases trustworthy: **the deterministic guard targets the attacker's GOAL, never a quoted token.** A model that correctly refuses will often explain the attack and quote its marker word, so canarying on the marker measures verbosity, not compromise. Instead each case pins the concrete thing the attacker wanted — a marker file that must not exist (`files exists:false`), a forbidden argument that must not reach `shell_run` (`toolUsageAudit.argsMustNotContain`, e.g. `rm -rf` / `curl`), or a secret value that must not appear in the reply (the `agentLoop.finalTextMustNotContain` canary, reserved for genuine secret material) — plus an LLM-judge rubric for the nuance. Five vectors ship today: a task-override block, secret exfiltration to a sibling file, a destructive-command instruction, one poisoned file among several in a batch read, and adversarial on-screen text. Off-CI (needs a model); wired into the optimization loop's `LLM_SUITES`.

### Other domains

The pure-data domains (`schema`, `tool_envelope`, `prefix_hash`, `argument_coercion`) follow the same shape — pick one of the existing `Suites/<domain>/*.json` cases as a template and copy it.

## Floors gate

`Config/floors.json` carries two floor families for `--fail-on-floor` (which the `make evals*` targets now pass by default; disable with `EVALS_FLOOR_FLAG=`):

- **`suitePassRates`** — per-suite minimum pass rate over scoreable rows (skipped rows excluded). The deterministic token-free suites are pinned at `1.0`: any failing row there is a code regression, never model flake. Suites not listed are unaffected, which is what makes the default-on flag safe for LLM suites. CI runs these suites with the gate via `make evals-deterministic` (the `test-evals` job).
- **`caseFloors`** — per-case `minMatches` recall floors (today: `capability_search`). When a floored case's accepted-hit count drops below `minMatches`, the run exits non-zero even if the case itself "passes" by softer criteria — the gate is independent of pass/fail outcome so it catches silent recall slippage the case-level matcher wouldn't. A `caseFloors` domain is skipped when the running suite has no cases of that domain; within a matching suite, a missing floored id still breaches (typo guard). Cases intentionally omitted from the floor map are documented in the file's `_comment`.

## Adding a new case

1. Drop `Suites/<Domain>/my-case.json` with the schema above (pick a sibling case as a template).
2. `swift run osaurus-evals run --suite Suites/<Domain> --filter my-case` to iterate.
3. Once green, run the whole suite to make sure you didn't break a sibling.
4. If your case asserts a recall floor, add it to `caseFloors` in `Config/floors.json` so `--fail-on-floor` covers it. New deterministic suites should also be listed under `suitePassRates` (and in the Makefile's `EVALS_DETERMINISTIC_SUITES` if CI-safe).

## Adding a new domain

1. Add `Suites/<NewDomain>/` with a few JSON cases.
2. In `Sources/OsaurusEvalsKit/EvalRunner.swift`, add a `case "<newdomain>":` arm to `runOne(...)`. Keep domain runners as separate top-level functions; merging them into one branch gets messy fast.
3. If the domain needs a new `expect.<sub>` block, add it to `EvalCase.Expectations` in `Sources/OsaurusEvalsKit/EvalCase.swift` (all sub-blocks are optional so existing cases keep decoding).
4. If the domain drives an LLM agent loop or a judge, add a public facade in OsaurusCore (mirror `CapabilityClaimsEvaluator`) rather than reaching into internal chat types from the evals package.

## CI isolation

This package is a **separate Swift package** — the eval *suites* never run on
CI because they burn tokens and need local models. The harness's own unit tests
do run on CI: `Tests/OsaurusEvalsKitTests` covers fixture decode, scorer
contracts, regression/scorecard labs, report/scoreboard rendering, and judge
resolution. Those tests are deterministic and token-free: no LLM calls and no
model loads. Run them locally with `make evals-test` or plain
`swift test --package-path Packages/OsaurusEvals`; the `test-evals` job in
`.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs the same thing on every PR. Tests that need
live resources stay behind env-var gates (`OSAURUS_EVALS_ENABLED=1`,
`OSAURUS_RUN_SANDBOX_INTEGRATION_TESTS=1`) so nothing burns tokens
unintentionally. Suite decode smokes assert **floor** counts (`>=`), so adding
cases never breaks them — only deletions or schema drift do.

## Future hooks (deliberately stubbed)

- Auto-run on new model release (CI workflow listening for HF releases).
- Domain growth: `Suites/ToolCalling/`.

Implemented (see "Optimization loop" above): `osaurus-evals diff` (all-domain
regression check), cross-model scoreboards (`osaurus-evals matrix`), and the
one-command `make evals-loop` pipeline.
